# ENVIRONMENT.md

# Presentation
First of all, we have to define and setup our working environment.<br>
No matter how much time you'll dev, all these components will usualy be needed to properly make and test your programs.<br>


### You'll need:

- **Computer [needed]**
  - OS (Windows, ~~Mac OS~~, Linux)
  - devkitPro
  - Switch emulator (Yuzu, Ryujinx...)
- **Nintendo Switch [optional]**
  - CFW (Atmosphère)

# Computer [needed]

You **MUST** use a computer to dev properly on Nintendo Switch.<br>
<br>
Tasks covered by the computer:<br>
- programmation (your best C/C++ editor)
- build (compilator)
- test (emulators)

## OS (Windows, ~~Mac OS~~, Linux)

You **can** use any of these 3 operating systems, since you can **dev** and **build** on all of them.<br>
<br>
Operating Systems:
- **Windows** [Recommended]
- ~~Mac OS~~ [NOT recommended]
- **Linux** [Recommended]


### Windows
Majority of the population use a Windows 10 system on their computer.<br>
It's **RECOMMENDED** to use it (if that's your actual OS), since the community made possible **dev, build, and test** homebrews on this popular OS, so **many people** can use it.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Please use the Windows 10 version of the OS (older and newer versions might be incompatible with some tools)

### ~~Mac OS~~
A handful of people are using Apple devices as main computer.<br>
It's **NOT recommended** to use it, since it's possible to **dev, and build** homebrews, but impossible to **test** them on this OS (emulators aren't available yet on Mac OS).

### Linux
Many people who like liberty, advanced usage, community... use a Linux system.<br>
It's **RECOMMENDED** to use it (if that's your actual OS), since the community made possible **dev, build, and test** homebrews on many distributions (prefer popular dists like Ubuntu)

## devkitPro

## Switch emulator (Yuzu, Ryujinx...)

# Nintendo Switch [optional]

A Nintendo Switch is **recommended** but **optional**, since you can run and test your homebrews on emulators.<br>
<br>
It's recommended because:<br>
-real console is often the platforme where people will use your homebrews (that's better to test them on real hardware)<br>
-you need to own a Nintendo Switch to play copyrighted contents on emulators, since you need Switch keys to decrypt games (legaly obtainable by dumping them with [Lockpick_RCM](https://github.com/shchmue/Lockpick_RCM) from your own device)

## CFW (Atmosphère)
