## Dev for Nintendo Switch ?

In first, you have to know: **dev isn't really different between computer and consoles.**<br>
**Write** a program, then **build** it to make it **readable** by a CPU.<br>
<br>
That's so close... that you can write a program for Windows and build it for Nintendo Switch (and invert).<br>
It usually needs some edits in the code, but that's possible.
