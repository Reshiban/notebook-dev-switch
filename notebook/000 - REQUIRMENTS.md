# IN FIRST...

**Welcome to my notebook introduction !**<br>
This book started in june 2022 ðŸ“•<br>
More we will be far of this date, more it will be completed.<br>
<br>
Are you actually a dev ? A simple user ?<br>
Developpment is a different experience for everyone: some people will understand everything fast, others will be slower but with others quality...<br>
Anyway one thing is sure: if you're really motivated, you'll be able to learn.<br>
<br>
Also, remember something: **dev isn't really different for computer and Nintendo Switch.**<br>
You'll have to adapt some things for the platform in the code, but the finality is the same: write a program, then build it to make it readable by a CPU.<br>
