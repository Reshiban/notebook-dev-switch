# I - Introduction

Now that you've set your [ENVIRONMENT](./001%20-%20ENVIRONMENT.md) properly, it's time to test it.<br>
We'll download existing source codes of NSwitch homebrews, then try to build them.

## What is build ?

Building is the process to transform source files in executable files.<br>
A build is usually done by 4 steps:<br>
**Preprocessing -> Compiling -> Assembling -> Linking**<br>
_[picture here](http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~mcmahon/CS241/Notes/build.html)_

### Preprocessing

The building process starts by the **preprocessing** step.<br>
It prepares the compilation process by re-arranging the source files.<br>
These are usually analysed to (by example) target variables and write some stuff inside, then copied in temp files.


### Compiling

The building process continue by the **compilation** step.<br>
That's when the process will translate the _preprocessed files_.<br>
It will translate source files (like C/C++ files) readable by humans, to assembler files readable by CPUs.<br>
