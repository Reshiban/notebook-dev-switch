# Introduction

This repository is made for people who want to start to dev in **C/C++** through Nintendo Switch homebrew dev.<br>
(firstly made for myself, to keep the trace of what I learnt, but why not sharing this publicly :p)<br>
<br>
# Status

It is empty for now, that's the start of the project...<br>
Please considere it like a notebook
